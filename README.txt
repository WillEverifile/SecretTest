This is a test of the Hannon Hill Secret.

It is writtne in Java, my weapon of choice, and requires Maven to build.
From the command line use: "mvn package" to build the project.
Use: "mvn test" to run the JUnit tests.
Once built, you can use the following command line to run the main program:
"java -cp target/SecretTest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.grayswan.secrettest.App 1000"
where 1000 is the maximum prime number to use.
